This is basically my web portfolio I have worked on for some period of time now.
It is mainly developed purely by use programming languages like HTML5, CSS3.
I also have used icons from https://boxicons.com website. 
I also have used images from my device in which you can get them by downloading via a link I'll improvise soon.
