This is basically my web portfolio I have worked on for some period of time now.
It is mainly developed purely by use programming languages like HTML5, CSS3.
I also have used icons from https://boxicons.com website. 
I also have used images from my device in which you can get them by downloading via a link I'll improvise soon.
You are free to take the template and you can modify it to your need having in mind not to by-pass the creator privacy and legal copyrights protocols.
The images I have used you can download them here on github at the developer environment or you can modify them and put yours to your wish.
